Exercise 01 – git/GitHub collaboration

General notes:
• This is only an exercise and will not be used as a base for your grade.
• This exercise is to be done in groups of 3 or 4 students. Choose your group members.
• Use the concepts that we briefly discussed during the last lecture, e.g. branching, not
working straight in the master/main branch and making pull requests to merge code.
• If in the end, you were not able to implement everything that you planned for, make sure
that the version of your project that is on your main branch is not broken.
• I will be available to guide you in case you need my help.

Hints:
• git clone REPO_URL
• git status
• git add .
• git commit -m “MESSAGE”
• git push
• git pull
• git log
• git checkout -b NEW_BRANCH_NAME
• git checkout TARGET_BRANCH_NAME
• git branch -a

### Task 01:

• Create a new repo on GitHub and invite your group members and even me (rasi10) as a
collaborator to the repo.
• Define a small project that you can work on with your team. The project should not be too small
so that you are finished too fast nor too long that you are not able to finish it. Examples:
o A calculator with functions beyond the basic arithmetic functions (+, -,\*, /)
o A small game that you can run in the console/terminal.
o Etc.
• Implement the project and share the responsibilities so that everyone in the group has enough
to do (The implementation should not take longer than 30 minutes).
• When you are finished with the implementation, you inform me so I can inject a bug in the
main branch.

### Task 02:

• Your team will get additional 20 minutes to fix the bug without working straight in the main
branch after the bug has been injected.

Task 03:

###

• Make a short presentation (around 5-7 minutes) where we all can see and discuss your strategy.
Relevant points to present:
o What is your project about?
o How did your team handle the collaboration and which part each one worked on?
o How did your team fixed the bug that was introduced?
o Any challenges? Takeaways?
